title: Registration Codes
---
A new system has been implemented to provide existing players and staff a way to obtain registration codes for new players.

The purpose of this system is to prevent abuse of account creation. Similar to `!unstuck`, the `!getcode` command may be used by any player meeting both of the following criteria:

- accumulated 120 hours (5 days) of playtime and
- main job level 15 or greater.

The `!getcode` command will return a **5 digit, one-time use registration code** that should be given to new players wishing to create an account (or existing players wishing to create alternate accounts). When a registration code is successfully used to create an account, a new code will take its place.

Existing players providing registration codes to new players will not be punished if the new player becomes banned for rule violations. However, requesting a registration code repeatedly for the purpose of mass account creation is prohibited, even if done over the course of several weeks.
