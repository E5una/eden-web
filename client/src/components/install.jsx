            <p>
                You'll need to follow one of the sections below to get Eden setup to play.
                But you'll also need to register an account on the website.
                You can do that via the <Link to="/tools?user=register">tools page</Link>.
            </p>

            <h3>Fresh Install 64-bit systems</h3>
            <p>
                First, you'll need to <a href={info.source1} rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">download the Eden Installer v4.1</a> to connect to Eden.
                You do not need to install retail FFXI firstâ€”this install will take care of everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                The files included in this installer were downloaded directly from SquareEnix's freely distributed client.
                If the first link is full you can use the <a href={info.source2} rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">alternative download.</a>
            </p>
            <Divider />
            <h3>Coming back / migrating from another private server</h3>
            <p>
                You will need to download <a href={info.bootloader} rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our modified bootloader</a>. You may want to visit our tech-support channel on <a href={info.discord} rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our Discord server</a> if you're having trouble.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can run the bootloader by itself to play on Eden but I suggest to use Ashita.</li>
                <li>We do not officially support Windower, but you may find some help getting it set up in our tech-support channel.</li>
                <li>Move <b>edenxi.exe</b> to your Ashita <b>ffxi-bootmod</b> directory. The default folder for this is <b>~\\Program Files (x86)\PlayOnline\Ashita\ffxi-bootmod</b></li>
                <li>DO NOT rename <b>edenxi.exe</b> or it will not work</li>
                <li>Open your Ashita configuration but right clicking a profile and then clicking "Edit configuration"</li>
                <li>In the File section you will see something like <b>.\\ffxi-bootmod\\pol.exe</b>. Ensure that this is changed to <b>.\\ffxi-bootmod\\edenxi.exe</b></li>
                <li>Command should include <b>--server play.edenxi.com --hairpin</b> and may optionally include <b>--user MYUSERNAME --pass MYPASSWORD</b> arguments so that you can automatically login.</li>
            </ul>
